# Overview

Stay-On-Track (SOT) is a web application designed to help users monitor all of the engagements they have with potential employers and recruiters. When applying to jobs, it can get a little hectic trying to keep track of everyone we've reached out to already. And it can be helpful to see contacts that friends and family have reached out to. So SOT offers a product that combines solutions for the two.

When a user visits the page, they can either sign up or log in. After signing up or logging in, a user is brought to the dashboard where they can see all the contacts in the database. A user can then browse the contacts list to see who they wish to contact, or if they don't see someone they wish to connect with, they can add that person to the contact list.

Once a user has reached out to a person in the contact list, they can come back to SOT and add an engagement. Engagements are what help keep track of who a user has reached out to. When creating an engagement, a user can add the method of contact (e.g. 'via email' or 'sent LinkedIn message') and any notes about the engagement. Once added, a user can then view their engagements on a separate table.
